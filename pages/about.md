# About

The AsthmaMap project is led by the European Institute for Systems Biology and Medicine, Lyon, France. The effort was initiated as a part of the IMI U-BIOPRED (Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes) data analysis and integration platform and then continued within IMI eTRIKS project (European Translational Information and Knowledge Management Services).  

An important part of the AsthmaMap development is the involvement of top experts in the field of asthma, allergic diseases and lung diseases. This way we make sure we are building a trusted reference resource and the results of this work go towards practical applications in clinics.  

AsthmaMap is being developed in close collaboration with the LCSB Parkinson's disease map team. MINERVA platform is employed for online visualisation.  

The AsthmaMap project progresses in alliance with other efforts of the Disease Maps Community and communicates with other groups for exchanging experience and best practices.

## Participate

We actively support the strengthening tendency to large-scale participative open-community projects for approaching complex diseases and welcome collaboration on the topic of high-quality reconstruction of asthma mechanisms, modelling, hypothesis generation and validation.
