# Cellular Interactions

The high-level view includes multiple cell types and is connected to the underlying pathways. It is designed to be used for data interpretation on systems level while keeping the focus on the involvement of different cell types in asthma pathogenesis.  

## AsthmaMap Cellular Interactions

Version 1.1 includes 22 cell types with more than 50 receptors connected to the corresponding pathways on the AF and PD layers. Omics data mapping and interpretation are ongoing. After sufficient validation, proposed endotypes can be used for redefining disease subtypes and fine-tuning of diagnosis and treatment.

### Content

The Cellular Interaction layer outlines asthma mechanisms and serves as a platform for communication with domain experts for defining the content of the AsthmaMap resources and elements to be included in the description of asthma mechanisms. This high-level view is connected to detailed layers and this way allows managing this complex and extensive reconstruction.

### Format

The diagram is created in the [yEd Graph Editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed#) in a rule-based format compatible with the [SBGN Activity Flow](http://sbgn.org/) (Le Nov√®re et al., 2009, [PMID 19668183](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19668183)).

### Applications

The Cellular Interactions layer is intended for 1) managing the AsthmaMap resource and defining disease hallmarks; 2) omics data visualisation via connecting this layer to the Activity Flow layer, 3) presenting asthma endotypes as patterns of cell types and pathways invovled.

### Availability

Available for downloding in various formats via [Downloads](/downloads/) page.

## AsthmaMap Cellular Interactions for buid 1.3 - ongoing work

In collaboration with the Laboratory for Translational Research and Personalised Medicine at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology we are preparing an improved version, [AsthmaMap Cellular Interactions build 1.3](/ci3/), with newly published research integrated and suggestions from our extended Editorial Panel taken into account.
